GymBuddy-A Social Networking Website for Fitness Enthusiasts

Description: This website provides a social networking experience for fitness enthusiasts. The technology used for this website is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. KendoUI widgets were used for some components of the website. This project was made for CS 575: Software Design at Drexel University.

Goals: This website aims to provide a unique social experience for fitness and exercise enthusiasts. The idea for this website came from the fact that fitness enthusiasts are always looking for a community for support and having a network of people to instill self-motivation. The main objective of this website is to empower the users to lead a healthy lifestyle through monitoring of exercise routines and diet. 

How to install: Installation is very easy. Download the files into a local directory and open the index.html file on any web browser.

How to use: It is very simple to use. However, it should be noted that this website has no database connectivity. The main page of the website has a slider and a login ID and password. Once the ID and password are entered (enter any random id and password), the home page will be displayed. All operations are static since there is no backend. Home page contains a schedule and a news feed. From this point, there are a variety of options. A workout schedule can be created by clicking on 'Track'. You can enter your exercise title, your start time and end time and the number of repetitions. Diet can be monitored by clicking on 'Diet'. You can enter the food consumed during breakfast, lunch, and dinner and otherwise. Friends and group list can be viewed by clicking on 'Connect'. Profile can be edited by clicking on 'Edit'. Tutorial videos can be watched by clicking on 'Help'. You can log out by clicking on 'Logout' and you will be directed to the start page.
